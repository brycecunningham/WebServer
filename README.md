# WebServer
Networks final project
(I worked with a partner on this)


A web server with the following functionality:

  - supports GET and HEAD requests 
  - accepts command line flags representing the TCP ports to bind to
  - supports encrypted connections via HTTPS using TLS (SSL 3.0)
  - listens simultaneously on HTTP and HTTPS ports using multithreading
  - supports persistent connections


To compile and run:
  - "$ make"
  - "$ java Server --serverPort=12345 --sslServerPort=12346" with desired port numbers
  
The project was completed in 2 parts.
